### üéØ **Project Goal**
Build a scalable Online Appointment Booking System to solve clinic booking chaos using a microservices-based architecture.

---

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**
```
Frontend (React.js)
      |
API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)
      |
+-----------------------------+
|        Backend (Spring Boot Microservices)         |
|                                                    |
| - User Service (Login/Register/Profile)            |
| - Appointment Service (Book/View/Cancel)           |
| - Doctor Service (Schedules/Specializations)       |
| - Notification Service (SMS/Email via Kafka)       |
| - Admin Service (Manage users, doctors, slots)     |
+----------------------------------------------------+
                |
            PostgreSQL / MongoDB
                |
        Kafka for async events (e.g. notifications)
```
